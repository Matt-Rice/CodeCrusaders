## 1. What is the software product?  (e.g. an accounting app, a dating, a sports app, etc.)
WellMind is a health and wellness application designed to make users lives simpler when it comes to their medical, nutritional, and general wellness goals. 

## 2. What are possible names of the product that you considered?
We proposed WellMind and that was the only name we considered because we agreed that it indicated the purpose of the app. 

## 3. What name did you finally choose?
We decided on the name WellMind since the app focuses on health and wellness (Well) and it also has a built in reminder feature (Mind).

## 4. Who are the potential customers, end users or buyers?
The potential users are the general public and especially those who are trying to lose weight, gain weight, or maintain weight by monitoring what they eat. Additionally
the users are those who take medicine and or want to keep track of tasks and events they need to complete like doctor's appointment and meetings.

## 5. What are the potential features, functions, or other important details that would be appealing to customers, end users or buyers? 
There is the MacroMonitor which is a nutrient and meal tracker that allows the user to log and plan their meals to help them meet their personal health goals. It will be able to monitor calorie, macro, and nutrient daily goals as well as be able to suggest foods and recipes based off of the foods the user likes. Then there is DailyDose, a medicine and general reminder section of the app which will be able to track what time(s) a medicine must be taken, what dosage of a medicine should be taken, what a medicine looks like, where a medicine is stored in the house, as well as general tasks, appointments, and notes. These and potentially the ability to log and plan workouts and calories will be the main features. of WellMind.

## Vision Statement
We hope that WellMind will become an application that allow for users to live a happier and healthy life by helping them to reach their health and finess goals by logging their meals and keeping track of their nutrient intake. We hope that it can help users keep their schedules on track by allowing them to set reminders for general tasks. We hope that it can allow users who take medicine, keep track of when and how much medicine to take, and other information regarding a user's pills.
