            <p class="tab-indent">James, a retired accountant who lives alone with two sons nearby, recently experienced a health scare when his heart entered a state of atrial fibrillation. After prescribing heart medications, his doctor also recommended the DASH diet—a heart-healthy eating plan low in saturated fat and sodium. Since his family has a history of high cholesterol and high blood pressure, his doctor advised him to carefully track his daily intake of fat and sodium to avoid future complications. James wants to try the DASH diet but isn’t sure how to get started with meal planning or nutrient tracking.</p>
            <p class="tab-indent">James has never used a meal planning app before and is unfamiliar with logging meals or tracking nutrients on his phone. He's comfortable using his iPhone but can find apps with too much text overwhelming. He needs an app that allows him to search for DASH-compliant recipes, log his meals, and easily view his daily nutrient goals for fat and sodium. Ideally, the app would offer a visual way to track how close he is to his limits for each nutrient and offer suggestions if he exceeds them.</p>
            <p class="tab-indent">James wants a user-friendly app that can provide an organized database of DASH diet recipes, with clear images and easy-to-follow steps. Track his daily intake of fat and sodium, giving him a simple, visual indicator of how close he is to reaching his limits. Suggest alternative meals or ingredients if he’s approaching his daily fat or sodium limit. Share his weekly food logs with his doctor or sons to keep them informed about his progress.</p>
            <p class="tab-indent">By using this app, James hopes to simplify his transition to the DASH diet and manage his nutrient intake without feeling overwhelmed, allowing him to focus on staying healthy while minimizing his chances of another health scare.</p>
